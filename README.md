# REDCapOMR
A project aiming to implement OMR and paper survey support into REDCap with the use of SDAPS and other software.  This is an external application currently only tested on a Linux distribution with PHP's localhost command line server.  Don't expect it to be functional in most circumstances yet.

(In logical order)

TODO: * Implement the View Printouts page,
      * Implement a "Project Settings" page to reset or delete projects from,
      * Upload scans uploaded by the user to their corresponding REDCap records when results are exported,
      * Create a Dockerfile and have the project capable of running in a Docker instance
